# Named Entity Recognition (NER) Project

## Overview

This project implements a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system. Named Entity Recognition is a sub-task of Information Extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into predefined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

## Features

- Preprocessing of text data
- Training NER models using machine learning/deep learning algorithms
- Evaluation of the model on test datasets
- Visualization of results

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git

### Libraries

You need the following Python libraries to run the project:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- keras
- nltk
- spacy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow keras nltk spacy matplotlib seaborn

Installation

    Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ner-project.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd ner-project

    Download NLTK and spaCy data:

python

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')

import spacy
spacy.cli.download("en_core_web_sm")

Usage

    Data Preparation:

    Place your training and test data in the data/ directory. Ensure the data is in a compatible format (e.g., CoNLL format).

    Training:

    Run the train_model.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to preprocess data and train the NER model.

    Evaluation:

    Run the evaluate_model.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to evaluate the trained model on the test dataset and visualize the results.

    Prediction:

    Use the predict.py script to predict named entities in new text data.

    Example:

    bash

    python predict.py "Your text here."
